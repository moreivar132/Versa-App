# EMPTY - NO VIOLATIONS
# Date: 2026-01-22
# 
# After Batch A14 completion, there are 0 files in runtime code (routes, services, controllers, src/modules)
# that bypass the tenant-safe database access pattern.
#
# All database access now goes through:
# - getTenantDb(ctx) for tenant-scoped queries
# - getSystemDb() for system-level operations (migrations, webhooks with tenant resolution)
# - txWithRLS() for transactional operations
#
# Files that previously had violations have been refactored in batches A1-A14.
# See: docs/RLS_PLAN.md and docs/MODULES/TENANT_DB.md for details.
#
# Allowed exceptions (in guardrails allowlist):
# - backend/db.js (core pool definition)
# - backend/src/core/db/ (tenant-db wrapper implementation)
# - backend/migrations/ (one-time scripts)
# - backend/scripts/ (CLI utilities)
# - backend/tests/ (test files)
# - backend/index.js (health check endpoint only)
